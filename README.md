# App-Prog-Project
Our project, Travella, brought to you by The Yung Money Team: Yzan Qaryouti, Marianno Reynoso, Truman Hickok, and Jeremy Cutrer

Extra things you'll need to do to run our app:
  1. In Project Properties, go to Java Compiler and change the Compiler Compliance Level to 1.8
  2. Get an internet connection (for the API calls)

Our app is an all in one travel planning app that can display available hotels, vehicle rentals, flights, events and monuments.

No known bugs.
